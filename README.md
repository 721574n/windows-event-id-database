# Windows Event ID Database

Windows Event ID Database is a JSON file containing the known Windows Event ID.

Being frustrated with the inability to find a single file with all known Windows Event ID, I gathered Windows Event ID in this repository
into a [single JSON file](./database/windowseventid.json).
